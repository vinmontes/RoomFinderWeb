## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/
 ├──config/                        * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js                 * helper functions for our configuration files
 |   ├──spec-bundle.js             * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 2 testing environment
